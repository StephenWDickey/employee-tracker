## Description 

In this week's challenge we were tasked with using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to create a professional content management system (CMS) for managing employees, departments, and positions.

The database is generated through MySQL, and table information can be obtained and read from the command line. Using the module 'mysql2' the project is able to do this through a createConnection() method. Another module, 'console.table', allows us to print our data to a table directly on the command line.

The bonus criteria have been met: this project features the ability to update employee managers, view employees by manager, view employees by department, delete departments, roles, and employees, and also the option to view department budgets.

This application will not be deployed, instead I will upload a video featuring the functionality of the project.
